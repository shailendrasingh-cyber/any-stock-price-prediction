# Stock Price Prediction App

This is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts stock prices using various machine learning models. Users can visualize real-time stock data, apply technical indicators, and forecast future prices based on historical data. The app fetches data from Yahoo Finance and provides interactive visualizations and predictions.

## Features

- **Download Historical Stock Data:** Fetch and visualize historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Technical Indicators:**
  - Close Price
  - Bollinger Bands (BB)
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- **Stock Price Prediction:** Predict future stock prices using multiple machine learning models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Extra Trees Regressor
  - K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
- **Forecast Visualization:** View predictions for future stock prices and compare them with actual data.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.
- **Made by Shailendra Singh**

## How It Works

The app processes stock data by:

1. **Fetching Data:** Retrieves historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Technical Indicators:** Calculates technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands, MACD, RSI, SMA, and EMA.
3. **Model Training:** Trains various machine learning models on the historical stock data.
4. **Prediction:** Predicts future stock prices based on the trained models.
5. **Visualization:** Displays the predictions and visualizations interactively.
